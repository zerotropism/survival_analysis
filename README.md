#### Survival Analysis on the Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)

The dataset comes from a clinical trial in the field of primary biliary cirrhosis conducted at the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 1984. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a fatal chronic liver disease.


A total of 418 PBC patients were randomized to either a placebo or a drug called D-penicillamine. Each of them was followed until death or censoring (the duration is measured in days). The status at endpoint is coded as follows: 0/1/2 for censored, transplant and dead respectively. In addition, 17 covariates are recorded for this study. These include a treatment variable, patient age, gender and clinical, biochemical and histologic measurements made at the time of randomization.


After preparing the data for in depth survival analysis (in part 2), the present work aimed to answer various questions related to the survival of the studied patients with biliary cirrhosis. From the very first one being “What does the survival of the patients look like overall?” we explicitely confronted their survival to selected covariates (part 3.3). We then studied the potentially existing differences between groups through unique covariates (part 3.4) and assessed both isolated and joint impact of progressively selected covariates on the survival through statistical significance (part 3.5). We finally produced the tests diagnostics (part 3.6) and concluded.
